# Data Science Certificate Project

This project serves as the final project to complete my professional Data Analyst certificate from IBM. 
It encompasses a collection of Jupyter Notebooks, each focusing on different aspects of data science.

## Project Goal
This project aims to analyze emerging programming skills and identify future skill requirements within the IT industry. By collecting data from job postings, training portals, and surveys, we extract valuable insights on top programming languages, in-demand database skills, and popular Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The project utilizes web scraping, API access, data wrangling, and statistical analysis techniques to derive meaningful conclusions.

## Features

- Collects data from various sources including job postings, training portals, and surveys.
- Performs data wrangling and prepares data for analysis.
- Applies statistical techniques to identify top programming languages, in-demand database skills, and popular IDEs.
- Visualizes findings using IBM Cognos Analytics to create interactive dashboards.
- Presents results through a compelling PowerPoint presentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
